- 1. Upload NFTs to Arweave *** MAKE SURE COMMANDS ARE BEING RUN FROM ONE LEVEL ABOVE ASSETS FOLDER ***
    -ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts upload ./assets --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
    -ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts verify --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json 

- 2. Create candy machine on Metaplex *** MAKE SURE COMMANDS ARE BEING RUN FROM ONE LEVEL ABOVE ASSETS FOLDER ***
    -ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts create_candy_machine --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -p 1
          candy machine pubkey: CdgS5QD6zfArgHYkpmrgWAd86ykrm1bvXU4Kx6KNHDXy
    - 

- 3. Update candy machine with proper drop date
    - ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts update_candy_machine --date "29 Dec 2021 00:12:00 GMT" --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json

- 4. .env created using values found in ./app/.cache/devnet-temp.json

-5. CandyMachine index.js file updated to collect and display metadata 
    - Still having issues with the .toNumber() that it wants me to run on the values being pulled from CandyMachine



## Error Log:
1. Error on importing React modules
    -App.js
        -Line 1:
        import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
    -because useEffect is not imported by default with React

2. Error on rendering connect button
    -App.js
        -Line 46
          const renderNotConnectedContainer = () =>{
            ->  return(<button
                className="cta-button connect-wallet-button"
                onClick={connectWallet}
                >
                    Connect to Wallet
                </button>)
            }
     -a return statement must be included in the renderNotConnectedContainer() function.

3. Encountered error when I tried to push assets to online repo
    - Narrowed it down to the hang up (error 8) being caused by 0.png (Clem).
    - Added file directly to online repo and called a git pull at the local level.
    - Not sure what the reason behind this error was -> will dig more into it tomorrow.

4. .toNumber() did not work in ./app/src/CandyMachine/index.js on line 285
    - used parseInt() to resolve issue. -> *** This was still not giving me the values I was looking for. Will come back to fix this eventually.
        - ..... I was spelling shit wrong. Did not need .toNumber() at all.
