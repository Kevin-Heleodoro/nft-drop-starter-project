## Error Log:
1. Error on importing React modules
    -App.js
        -Line 1:
        import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
    -because useEffect is not imported by default with React
2. Error on rendering connect button
    -App.js
        -Line 46
          const renderNotConnectedContainer = () =>{
            ->  return(<button
                className="cta-button connect-wallet-button"
                onClick={connectWallet}
                >
                    Connect to Wallet
                </button>)
            }
     -a return statement must be included in the renderNotConnectedContainer() function.
3. Encountered error when I tried to push assets to online repo
    - Narrowed it down to the hang up (error 8) being caused by 0.png (Clem).
    - Added file directly to online repo and called a git pull at the local level.
    - Not sure what the reason behind this error was -> will dig more into it tomorrow.
